<h2>정덕기는 정말 <strong><u>바보</u></strong> 같은 인간이다.</h2>
<p>Roberta Williams (born 1953) is an American video game designer and writer who co-founded Sierra On-Line with her game developer husband, Ken Williams. Her first game, Mystery House, was released in 1980, became a modest commercial success, and is credited as the first graphic adventure game. She is also known for creating and maintaining the King's Quest series, as well as designing the 1995 full motion video game Phantasmagoria. After Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996, she grew increasingly frustrated with CUC's creative and business decisions. She left the game industry and focused on her travels and historical fiction writing. In 2021, she released the historical novel Farewell to Tara. Several publications have named Roberta Williams as one of the best or most influential creators in the video game industry. She has received the Industry Icon Award from The Game Awards, and the Pioneer Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards.</p>
